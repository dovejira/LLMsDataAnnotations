# LLMsDataAnnotations
This is an AI project where we discussed the feasibility and accuracy of using different large-scale models for annotation.
In this document, we discussed several methods for conducting data annotation and compared their accuracy. Most of the code is encapsulated in functions and can be used for direct path swapping and analysis.
With the AI in J&C course assignment from Dr. Bao, relevant issues have received support from course stakeholders and the school.
